# Malware for Fun 🎉

## 🤖 Just for Fun!

This repository contains a collection of **harmless malware-inspired scripts**, made purely for fun and to expand my understanding of cybersecurity and ethical hacking. These files are here just to mess around, experiment, and learn more about how malware behaves in a **controlled, safe environment**.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**Don't worry!** The code here is NOT dangerous as long as you stick to safe practices. However, as with any code inspired by malware:

- **DO NOT** run these scripts on your main computer.
- Always use a **virtual machine** or some kind of sandbox.
- This project is strictly for **personal learning** and **fun purposes only**.
- I am not responsible for any issues caused by running this code in the wrong environment!

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo is mainly for:
- **Learning about malware mechanics** in a hands-on way.
- **Exploring fun scripts** that mimic malware behavior.
- **Experimenting with virtual environments** for safe testing.
